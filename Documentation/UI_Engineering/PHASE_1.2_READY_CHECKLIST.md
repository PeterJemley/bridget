## 🚀 **Ready to Begin Phase 1.2: Atomic Design Layer Classification**

### **What We Have:**
1. **Complete component inventory** - All 36 View components cataloged
2. **Automated analysis tools** - Discovery script ready for ongoing use
3. **Baseline measurements** - Current state documented for comparison
4. **Clear improvement targets** - 101 files need accessibility, 15 files need refactoring

### **What We Need for 1.2:**
1. **Detailed atomic design analysis** - Deep dive into Atoms, Molecules, Organisms
2. **Component relationship mapping** - Dependencies and inheritance patterns
3. **Design token extraction** - Colors, typography, spacing standardization
4. **Cross-reference with Figma** - Design-to-code consistency verification

## 📊 **Key Metrics for 1.2 Success**

### **Current State (Baseline)**
- **Atoms:** 15+ identified (Colors, Typography, Icons)
- **Molecules:** 8+ identified (Buttons, Cards, Charts)
- **Organisms:** 12+ identified (Views, Sections, Complex Components)
- **Accessibility Coverage:** 5% (101 files need improvement)
- **Large Files:** 15 files >500 lines

### **Target State (After 1.2)**
- **Atoms:** Fully documented with design tokens
- **Molecules:** Standardized with usage guidelines
- **Organisms:** Optimized with clear relationships
- **Accessibility Coverage:** 95%+ (target improvement)
- **Large Files:** 50% reduction in files >500 lines

   - Review large organism components
   - Identify refactoring opportunities
   - Optimize component relationships

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze rendering performance
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Implement performance monitoring

### **Week 4: Integration & Documentation**
1. **Cross-Reference Implementation**
   - Link with Figma design files
