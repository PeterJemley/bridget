## 📋 **Alternative Templates**

### **For UI Development:**
```
Hi! Working on Bridget UI development. We have 25+ components cataloged 
and need to focus on accessibility (5% coverage) and large file refactoring 
(15 files >500 lines). 

Current priority: [specific task]
Reference: ../UI_Engineering/UI_ELEMENT_REGISTRY.md
```

### **For Analysis:**
```
Hi! Need to run analysis on Bridget project. We have automated discovery 
script ready. 

Please run: ./Scripts/ui_element_discovery.sh
Then show me: accessibility status, large files, HIG compliance, next steps
```

### **For Accessibility:**
```
Hi! Working on Bridget accessibility implementation. Current coverage is 5% 
(101 files need work). 

Need to: implement accessibility for [specific component/feature]
Reference: ../Accessibility/ACCESSIBILITY_INSPECTOR_GUIDE.md
```

### **For Documentation:**
```
Hi! Need to update Bridget documentation. We have organized structure with 
6 categories and tagging system.

Need to: [specific documentation task]
