## 🚀 Features

- **Bridge Status**: Historical and recent bridge opening data for Seattle drawbridges (4900+ events, 7 bridges), updated as data becomes available from public sources.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Probability scoring, duration estimates, and smart reasoning for bridge openings.
- **Traffic Cascade Detection**: See how one bridge opening affects others.
- **Route Planning**: Apple Maps integration, bridge-aware routing, and alternative route suggestions.
- **Indirect Bridge Delay Detection**: Uses Apple Maps congestion data to detect bridge-caused traffic delays.
- **Motion-Aware Predictions**: Uses device motion sensors to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Advanced Statistics Dashboard**: Historical pattern analysis, network diagrams, and traffic impact summaries.
- **Modern SwiftUI Interface**: iOS 17+ design, dark mode, accessibility, and smooth animations.
- **Smart Notifications**: Proactive alerts for bridge openings and traffic changes.
- **Privacy-First**: No personal data collection; all processing is local and secure.

## 📱 Getting Started

### Requirements

- iOS 17.0 or later
- Xcode 15+
- iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PeterJemley/Bridget.git
   ```
2. **Open in Xcode:**
   - Open `Bridget.xcodeproj`.
   - Ensure all Swift packages resolve correctly.
3. **Build & Run:**
   - Use the iPhone 16 Pro simulator (recommended) or your real device.
   - Grant location and motion permissions when prompted.

## 🏆 What Makes Bridget Special?

- **Predicts bridge openings before they happen** using AI and months of historical data.
- **Understands traffic chain reactions**—when one bridge opens, others often follow.
- **Adapts to your travel context** (vehicle, cycling, etc.) for more relevant predictions.
- **Continuously learns** from new data and device capabilities.

## 🚧 Current Development Status

### **✅ What's Working**
- **App runs successfully** on iPhone 16 Pro simulator
- **All 10 packages compile** without errors
- **4900+ bridge events loaded**, 7 bridges available
- **Routes Tab UI** - Basic routing interface functional
- **TrafficAwareRoutingService** - Fully functional with risk builder
- **Test infrastructure** - 95% of tests passing (51/55 tests)

### **🟡 In Progress**
- **Indirect Bridge Delay Detection**: Apple Maps congestion correlation (CRITICAL priority)
- **Motion Detection Integration**: Real device testing and dashboard integration
- **Background Location Services**: CoreLocation integration and geofencing
- **Routes Tab Enhancement**: Traffic indicators and bridge risk visualization

### **📋 Development Priorities**
- **This Week**: Real device testing, BridgeCongestionMonitor implementation
