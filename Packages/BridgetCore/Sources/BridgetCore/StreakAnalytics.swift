/**
 * Comprehensive analytics for bridge opening streaks and patterns
 * 
 * This module provides sophisticated streak analysis capabilities for bridge activity monitoring,

 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Weekly streak champion identification
 * - Historical streak pattern analysis
 * - Next opening prediction with confidence scoring
 * - Bridge performance ranking and comparison
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```swift
 * let champion = StreakAnalytics.calculateWeeklyChampion(from: events)
 * let streakData = StreakAnalytics.calculateStreakData(for: "Fremont Bridge", events: events)
 * ```
