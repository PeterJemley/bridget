5. Verify app remains responsive

**Expected Results**:
- Battery usage is reasonable (<5% per hour)
- Memory usage remains stable
- App remains responsive when returning to foreground

### 6. Background Task Cleanup Test

**Objective**: Verify proper cleanup when monitoring stops

**Steps**:
1. Start background monitoring
2. Background app
3. Stop monitoring from dashboard
4. Verify background tasks are properly ended
5. Check for memory leaks

**Expected Results**:
- Background tasks are properly terminated
- No memory leaks detected
- System resources are freed

### 7. Alert Generation Test

**Objective**: Verify background alerts are generated and displayed

**Steps**:
1. Start background monitoring
2. Background app
3. Wait for alert conditions (traffic, motion, etc.)
4. Return to app
5. Check alert list in background monitoring card
6. Verify alert details are correct

**Expected Results**:
- Alerts are generated for appropriate conditions
- Alert list shows recent alerts
- Alert details are accurate and informative

### 8. Network Integration Test

**Objective**: Verify background monitoring works with network connectivity

**Steps**:
1. Start background monitoring
2. Toggle airplane mode on/off
3. Check if monitoring adapts to network changes
4. Verify error handling for network issues

**Expected Results**:
- Monitoring adapts to network availability
- Graceful handling of network errors
- No crashes during network transitions

## ðŸ”§ Debug Information

### Console Logs to Monitor
Look for these log messages during testing:
- `ðŸš— [Background] Starting background monitoring...`
- `ðŸš— [Background] Background monitoring started`
- `ðŸš— [Background] Performing background traffic check...`
- `ðŸš— [Background] Background traffic check completed`
- `ðŸš— [Background] Stopping background monitoring...`

### Key Metrics to Track
- Background task duration
- Memory usage over time
- Battery consumption
- Alert generation frequency
- Network request frequency

## ðŸš¨ Known Limitations

1. **Simulator Limitations**: Background processing may not work exactly the same in simulator
2. **iOS Background Restrictions**: iOS may limit background execution time
3. **Network Dependencies**: Some features require network connectivity
4. **Motion Detection**: Requires real device for accurate motion detection

## ðŸ“± Device Requirements

- **iOS Version**: 17.0 or later
- **Device**: iPhone with motion sensors (for full functionality)
- **Permissions**: Location and Motion permissions required
- **Network**: Internet connectivity for traffic data

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

Background processing is considered successful if:
- âœ… App can monitor traffic conditions in background
- âœ… Motion detection integrates properly
- âœ… Alerts are generated for significant events
- âœ… Battery usage remains reasonable
- âœ… No crashes or memory leaks
- âœ… Proper cleanup when monitoring stops

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps After Testing

1. **Performance Optimization**: If battery usage is high, optimize background tasks
2. **Alert Refinement**: Adjust alert thresholds based on user feedback
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with other app features
4. **User Experience**: Gather feedback on alert usefulness and frequency

## ðŸ“ž Support

If issues are encountered during testing:
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify device permissions are granted
3. Test on different iOS versions if possible
4. Document specific error conditions for debugging

**Last Updated**: July 8, 2025
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Ready for Testing 

## 9. Motion Detection Debugging Test

**Objective**: Debug and verify the accuracy of motion detection, especially speed and acceleration readings when stationary.

**Steps:**
1. Place the device on a stable, stationary surface.
2. Start background monitoring and motion detection.
3. Observe the speed and acceleration values reported in the app.
4. Note any non-zero values when the device is not moving.
5. Move the device slightly and observe how quickly the values change.
6. Repeat in different environments (e.g., on a table, in a car, outdoors).

**Expected Results:**
- Speed and acceleration should be close to zero when stationary (allowing for minor sensor noise).
- Values should update responsively when the device is moved.
- If persistent non-zero values are observed, log the raw sensor data for further analysis.

## 10. Speed/Acceleration Thresholding Test (User-Facing)

**Objective**: Ensure that small, insignificant speed/acceleration values are not shown to the user, improving clarity.

**Steps:**
1. Place the device stationary and start monitoring.
2. Observe the displayed speed/acceleration values.
3. Confirm that values below the defined threshold (e.g., < 0.2 m/s for speed, < 0.05 m/sÂ² for acceleration) are displayed as zero or "stationary".
4. Move the device to exceed the threshold and confirm values are displayed accurately.
5. Test in both background and foreground modes.

**Expected Results:**
- When stationary, the app displays zero or "stationary" for speed/acceleration.
- Only significant movement is shown to the user.
- No flickering or rapid changes between zero and non-zero values due to noise.
