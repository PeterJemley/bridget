## üéØ **Current Project Status**

### **‚úÖ Stable Components**
- **Core Build System** - All modules compile successfully
- **Test Infrastructure** - All tests build and run (most passing)
- **Routing Module** - Fully functional with risk builder
- **Basic UI Components** - All SwiftUI views properly initialized
- **Data Models** - SwiftData models working correctly
- **Modular Architecture** - Package dependencies properly configured

### **üü° Partially Stable Components**
- **Motion Detection Service** - Builds successfully, needs real device testing
- **Statistics Visualization** - Core works, some placeholders remain
- **Analytics Engine** - Basic functionality, needs advanced algorithms

### **‚ùå Unstable/Missing Components**
- **ARIMA Prediction Engine** - Completely empty placeholder file
- **Background Processing** - Not implemented
- **Location Services** - Not implemented
- **Advanced Settings** - Placeholder only

## üöÄ **What's Left To Do (Prioritized Next Steps)**

### **Critical (This Week)**
- [ ] **Implement ARIMA Prediction Engine** - Core prediction functionality missing
  - File: `Packages/BridgetCore/Sources/BridgetCore/ARIMAPredictionEngine.swift`
  - Status: Completely empty placeholder
  - Priority: Critical - Core functionality missing
  - Estimated Time: 8-12 hours

- [ ] **Integrate motion detection into dashboard** - User-facing feature
  - Status: Builds successfully but needs integration
  - Priority: High - User-facing feature
  - Estimated Time: 4-6 hours

### **High Priority (Next 2 Weeks)**
- [ ] **Complete cascade analysis visualization** - Statistics feature
  - File: `Packages/BridgetStatistics/Sources/BridgetStatistics/StatisticsView.swift`
  - Status: Uses placeholder when no data
  - Estimated Time: 6-8 hours

- [ ] **Implement dynamic analysis algorithms** - Bridge detail feature
  - File: `Packages/BridgetBridgeDetail/Sources/BridgetBridgeDetail/DynamicAnalysisSection.swift`
  - Status: Placeholder content on lines 181, 186, 362
  - Estimated Time: 8-10 hours

- [ ] **Add background processing** - Continuous monitoring
  - Status: Motion detection only works when app is active
  - Estimated Time: 8-12 hours

### **Medium Priority (Next Month)**
- [ ] **Add location services integration** - GPS-based features
  - Status: Not implemented
  - Missing: Real GPS-based distance calculations, route-based predictions
  - Estimated Time: 10-15 hours

- [ ] **Implement real settings functionality** - User preferences
  - File: `Packages/BridgetSettings/Sources/BridgetSettings/SettingsView.swift`
  - Status: Line 29 shows "Placeholder for future settings"
  - Estimated Time: 4-6 hours

- [ ] **Advanced ML pattern recognition** - Enhanced predictions
  - Status: Basic functionality, needs enhancement
  - Estimated Time: 12-16 hours

### **Polish & Optimization**
- [ ] **Further polish the Routes Tab UI** - User experience improvements
- [ ] **Add advanced routing features** - Multi-stop, user preferences
- [ ] **Gather user feedback** - Iterate on navigation features
- [ ] **Optimize performance** - Large datasets and real-time updates
- [ ] **Expand risk builder usage** - Richer user messaging
