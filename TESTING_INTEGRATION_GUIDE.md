# Bridget App Testing Integration Guide
## How Automated & Manual Testing Work Together

## 🤝 **TESTING STRATEGY INTEGRATION**

The Bridget app uses a **dual-layer testing approach** where automated and manual tests are specifically designed to complement each other:

### **Layer 1: Automated Foundation** 🤖
- **Purpose**: Validate functionality, prevent regressions, ensure data integrity
- **Coverage**: Logic, calculations, error handling, performance benchmarks
- **Speed**: Runs in seconds, can be repeated frequently
- **Scope**: Tests the "what" - does the code work correctly?

### **Layer 2: Manual Verification** 👨‍💻  
- **Purpose**: Validate user experience, visual design, real-world workflows
- **Coverage**: UI/UX, navigation flows, device-specific features, edge cases
- **Speed**: Takes 30-45 minutes for comprehensive testing
- **Scope**: Tests the "how" - does the app work well for users?
